This directory contains code for practical 6:
	1. matrixmult.c
	2. matrixmult.f90

The subdirectories (step6-c and step6-Fortran) contain code which performs the
same function as 1 and 2 above, but they are broken into seperate files (main 
and object) which are compiled using the Makefiles contained within.
